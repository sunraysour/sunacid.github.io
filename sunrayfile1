<br>
This might not work for everyone but I think it is worth trying first yourself until you know more about whether it’s good or useless for you. You won’t ever know for sure how good (or bad) something is until you it try it yourself.
Try sunbathing (with right amount of exposure of course.)
<br>
Try consuming apple cider vinegar (with right amount of exposure of course. To be safe, start with small dilution with water. You should decide how much is right for you.)
<br>
Don’t go to dark areas too often. Stay close to indirect sunlight to help brighten your life, literally.
<br>
Make your body posture like a seahorse. (More info in the post with that description.)
<br>
Try to relax more.
<br>
Sometimes taking more time for yourself could help you to discover unique insights and discoveries that is very valuable and with this you can compensate for some of the short-term delays and broken promises you made with others by helping them with your newfound knowledge and wisdom.</p>
